        <td> This is a drawing I created on Photoshop. I started with a transparent background, then colored the background and finally added the details. Upon first glance, this picture appears to be an underwater scene with frothy bubbles, seaweed and the light filtering in through the surface. But on another level, the blue water is really the sky set against a field of grass, and leaves are floating down in the air.
