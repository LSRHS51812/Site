<h2> Three Main Image Formats Used on the Web: PNG, JPEG, and GIF </h2>

  <table align="center">

    <tr>
          <td> JPEG </td>
          <td> JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created this format. It is also known as JPG; the ending is typed as .jpeg or .jpg. A JPEG image is compressed so it can store large amounts of information in a small file. These are often used on the web, as they load easily and look good at the same time. However, the compression causes the image to lose detail; thus, jpeg files are not optimal for line drawings or graphics because they can look jagged rather than smooth. JPEG files cannot display transparent backgrounds. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td> GIF is an abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. GIF files are animated by combining many other images or frames into a single file; this succession of images creates a short movie. Unlike jpeg, this does not degrade image quality. GIFs can stop after the last image is displayed, or it can be programed to repeat a certain number of times or on an endless loop. </td>
        <td> GIF </td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
        <td> PNG </td>
        <td> PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics; it was created to replace GIFs. Not only can it display transparent backgrounds like GIFs, it is the most frequently used compressed raster image format on the web. Unlike a JPEG, a PNG uses a compression algorithm that does not lose any of the fileâ€™s information. Although the quality does not degrade, the file size is often larger. PNG also supports image transparency. </td>
